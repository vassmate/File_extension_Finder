# File_extension_Finder
Repository for a file extension finder application.

# Description
A simple application for finding all files with a given extension in a directory. It has a simple graphical user interface. 
I made this for practicing and learning about java GUI development as well as lambda functions and the Stream api which were came in with Java 8. 

Originally it did not use these new features so I thought I rewrite the search functions and the result was much less code while the application retains the same functionality.
